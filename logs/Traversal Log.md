# Traversal log
2026 Feb. 3 - Vault initialized. No rooms mapped yet.

# Canonical rule
On first entry into any new room:
1. **Index it immediately** (create the room file, assign Hidden ID)
2. **Record it in the Traversal Log** with a minimal entry.
Indexing is structural; traversal logging is evidentiary.

## Minimum protocol
**Bare-minimum entry format**:

[Date / Session]

Entered: Z1 - X from Z1 - X
Lighting:
