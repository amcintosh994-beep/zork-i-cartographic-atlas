# Purpose and scope
This vault is a **cartographic and analytic project** that treats the Zork series as a set of *textual systems whose spatial logics must be documented as they are enacted*, not as they are narratively implied.

Accordingly, **Zork I**, **Zork 2**, **and Zork II are treated as distinct textual worlds**, even where they appear to share locations, names, or narrative continuity.

Continuity is an *analytic question*, not an assumption.

# Core principles
## 1. Zork I-III as distinct textual systems
Each Zork game is understood as its own:
* parser environment
* rule set
* state model
* spatial topology
* affordance grammar
Even when room names recur, (e.g., *Kitchen*, *Living Room*, *Cellar*), this does **not** imply identity.
Rooms with the same name across games may:
* differ in exits or directionality
* differ in lighting behaviour
* differ in state persistence
* differ in hazards or affordances
* or differ only subtly but meaningfully.
These differences matter and must not be erased.

## Room indexing policy
All rooms are indexed by **game + room name**, using the following convention:

Z1 – Room – Kitchen
Z2 – Room – Kitchen
Z3 – Room – Kitchen

This ensures that:
* no two rooms are ever silently merged,
* links remain unambiguous,
* parser behaviour is preserved in context,
* and cross-game comparison remains possible.
Rooms are indexed by **textual instantiation**, not by presumed narrative identity.

## 3. Structural separation vs. analytic integration
**Structural rule:**
Rooms are never merged across games at the file or canvas level.

**Analytic rule**:
Possible equivalence, continuity, or retcon is handled *only* in analysis.

This means:
* Canvasses for Zork I, II, and III remain separate
* A future *Composite Canvas* is allows **only** as an analytic overlay.
* Structural unity is never enforced prematurely.
Any claim that two rooms the "the same place" must be:
* argued,
* documented,
* and explicitly marked as provisional or contested.

## 4. Equivalence is logged, not enforced
Suspected overlap between rooms across games is recorded in analytic notes (e.g., a future *Room Equivalence Log*), using language such as:
* strong equivalence
* weak equivalence
* symbolic reuse
* narrative retcon
* mechanical divergence
At no point should equivalence be resolved by:
* renaming files,
* collapsing nodes,
* or deleting distinctions "for neatness".
Neatness is not the goal. Fidelity is.

## 5. Canvases: authoritative vs. analytic
* **Authoritative canvases**
	* Zork I - World.canvas
	* Zork II - World.canvas
	* Zork III - World.canvas
	These represent traversal *as played*, with no cross-game synthesis.
* **Analytic canvas (future)**
	* Zork I-III - Composite.canvas
	
This canvas may:
	* juxtapose rooms,
	* draw conjectural links,
	* marks tensions or contradictions,
	* visualize continuity claims *without resolving them.*
The composite canvas is an argument, not a map.

# Explicit warning to Future-Me
If you are reading this and thinking:
* "These are basically the same room, I'll just merge them", or
* "This would be cleaner if I collapsed these nodes", or
* "Continuity is obvious here, no need to be pedantic",
**Stop.**

That impulse is precisely what this project is designed to resist.

Zork's world is not a stable Euclidean space.
It is a layered textual artifact whose inconsistencies are *data*, not errors.

# Closing commitment
This project prioritizes:
* parser behaviour over narrative intuition
* enacted topology over implied geography
* analytic clarity over cartographic tidiness.
Any future integration must be **explicit, reversible, and argued**, never silent or structural.
