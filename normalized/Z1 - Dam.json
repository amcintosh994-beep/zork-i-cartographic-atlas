    "Description (verbatim)": "You are standing on the top of the Flood Control Dam #3, which was quite a tourist attraction in times far distant. There are paths to the north, south, and west, and a scramble down.\nThe sluice gates on the Dam are closed.\nBehind the Dam, there can be seen a wide reservoir. Water is pouring over the top of the now abandoned dam.\nThere is a large control panel here, on which a large metal bolt is mounted. Directly above the bolt is a small green plastic bubble.",
