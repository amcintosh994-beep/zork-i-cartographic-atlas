    "Description (verbatim)": "As you enter the Barrow, the door closes inexorably behind you. Around you it is dark, but ahead is an enormous cavern, brightly lit. Through its center runs a wide stream. Spanning the stream is a small wooden footbridge, and beyond a path leads into a dark tunnel. Above the bridge, floating in the air, is a large sign that reads: *All ye who stand before this bridge have completed a great and perilous adventure which has tested your wit and courage. You have mastered the first part of the Zork trilogy.\nThose who pass over must be prepared to undertake an even greater adventure that will severely test your skill and bravery!*\n\nThe Zork Trilogy continues with \"Zork II: The Wizard of Frobozz\" and is completed in \"Zork III: The Dungeon Master.\"",
