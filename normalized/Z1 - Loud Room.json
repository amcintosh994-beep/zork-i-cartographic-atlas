    "Description (verbatim)": "(If descending from above:) On the ground is a large Platinum Bar.\nIt is unbearably loud here, with an ear-splitting roar seeming to come from all around you. There is a pounding in your head which won't stop. With a tremendous effort, you scramble out of the room.\n\n(If entering from Round Room:) This is a large room with a ceiling which cannot be detected from the ground. There is a narrow passage from east to west and a stone stairway leading upward. The room is deafeningly loud with an undetermined rushing sound. The sound seems to reverberate from all of the walls, making it difficult even to think.\nOn the ground is a large platinum Bar.",
