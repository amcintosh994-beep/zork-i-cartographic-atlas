    "Description (verbatim)": "You hear a scream of anguish as you violate the robber's hideaway. Using passages unknown to you, he rushes to its defense.\nThe Thief gestures mysteriously, and the treasures in the room suddenly vanish.\n\nTreasure Room\nThis is a large room, whose east wall is solid granite. A number of discarded bags, which crumble at your touch, are scattered about on the floor. There is an exit down a staircase.\nThere is a suspicious-looking individual, holding a large bag, leaning against one wall. He is armed with a deadly stiletto.\nThere is a Silver Chalice, intricately engraved, here.",
