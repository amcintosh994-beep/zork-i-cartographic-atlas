# Altar

## Description (verbatim)
This is the south end of a large Temple. In front of you is what appears to be an altar. In one corner is a small hole in the floor which leads into darkness. You probably could not get back up it.
On the two ends of the Altar are burning Candles.
On the Altar is a large black Book, open to page 569.
