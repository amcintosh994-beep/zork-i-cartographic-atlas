# Z1 - Cyclops Room

## Description (verbatim)
This room has an exit on the northwest, and a staircase leading up.
A cyclops, who looks prepared to eat horses (much less mere adventurers), blocks the staircase. From his state of health, and the bloodstains on the walls, you gather he is not very friendly, though he likes people.

## Exits (as reported)
- NW → [[Z1 - Maze O]]
- E → [[Z1 - Strange Passage]]
- U → [[Z1 - Treasure Room]]

## Blocked movements
- E → "The east wall is solid rock."
- U (while Cyclops is present) → "The cyclops doesn't look like he'll let you past."

## Hidden/conditional transitions
- U → [[Z1 - Treasure Room]] becomes available once Cyclops flees
- Cyclops fleeing causes destruction of nailed door in [[Z1 - Living Room]]
