# Z1 - Reservoir South

## Description (verbatim)
You are in a long room on the south shore of a large lake, far too deep and wide for crossing.
There is a path along the stream to the east or west, a steep pathway climbing southwest along the edge of a chasm, and a path leading into a canyon to the southeast.

## Exits (as reported)
- E → [[Z1 - Dam]]
- SE → [[Z1 - Deep Canyon]]
- SW → [[Z1 - Chasm]]
- W → [[Z1 - Stream View]]
- N (when water level is lowered): → [[Z1 - Reservoir]]

## Blocked movements
- N (when water level is high): "You would drown."

## Hidden/conditional transitions
Once water has been lowered: "You are in a long room, to the north of which was formerly a lake. However, with the water level lowered, there is merely a wide stream running through the center of the room.
"There is a path along the stream to the east or west, a steep pathway climbing southwest along the edge of a chasm, and a path leading into a canyon to the southeast."
