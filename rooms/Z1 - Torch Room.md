# Z1 - Torch Room

## Description (verbatim)
This is a large room with a prominent doorway leading to a down staircase.
Above you is a large dome. Up around the edge of the dome (20 feet up) is a wooden railing. In the center of the room sits a white marble pedestal.
A piece of rope descends from the railing above, ending some five feet above your head.
Sitting on the pedestal is a flaming Torch, made of ivory.
